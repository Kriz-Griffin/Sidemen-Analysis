> Brief intro about sidemen

The Sidemen YouTube channel is the collaboration of seven British YouTubers: Simon (Miniminter), Josh (Zerkaa), Tobi (TBJZL), Ethan (Behzinga), Harry (W2S), Vik (Vikkstar123), and JJ (KSI). It has been one of the most popular group channels ever on the platform. Launched initially in 2013, the Sidemen was originally a gaming channel, particularly on *FIFA*, but soon evolved to house a wide range of content such as vlogs and challenges, travel adventures, and collaborations, thus attaining huge global following.

Among such contents, the Sidemen's Among Us videos were one of the most popular hits during its hight peak in the year 2020. In this video series, the team plays the social deduction game of Among Us with their friends and fellow creators. The group has to finish tasks within a spaceship while figuring out who among them is the "Impostor" working to disrupt the mission. The show quickly earned audience appreciation because of every member's style, mixing comedy, strategy, and every unreliable interaction with one another that made for a great and memorable episode every time.
